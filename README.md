This project showcases the characters from the acclaimed animated series Rick and Morty. <br />
It leverages an API to dynamically fetch character data, including: <br />

**Name:** The character's full name. <br />
**Image:** A URL pointing to the character's image. <br />
**Status:** The character's current status, indicated as either "Alive," "Dead," or "Unknown". <br /> 

### Functionality:

* **Data Fetching:** The code retrieves character information from the API, ensuring the web page stays up-to-date.
* **Character Display:** The fetched character data is transformed into a visually appealing card format for presentation on the web page,  <br />
with clear labels for each field (Name, Image, Status).
* **Error Handling:** The application gracefully handles potential errors that might arise during the API interaction, displaying informative messages to the user.
